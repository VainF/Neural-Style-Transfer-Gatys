# Neural-Style-Transfer-Gatys
This is a Tensorflow implementation of the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf) by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge. 

## Some details

* The pretrained VGG19 model comes from this [repo](https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg).  
* Some implementations are inspired by [Neural Transfer with PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html)
